#Kenneh's RuneScape Loader

This loader was made for ease of use when playing RuneScape. This client does not break the rules and does not have any illegal tools.
It simply allows you to choose what game mode you want to play when it launches. Click the corresponding button to play that mode.
There is a TrayIcon that will appear in your task bar once you start the client. Right clicking it will give options such as screenshot, a stats checker, and a ge item checker.
The screenshot function can also be used by pressing f12. By default, screenshots upload to imgur and the link will get pasted to your clipboard.
